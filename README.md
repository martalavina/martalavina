Connecting athletic discipline with digital innovation

## About

I grew up on the ice. Still there most mornings, training, competing, coaching. Figure skating has taken me across **Slovenia, Bulgaria, Canada, Italy, France** and beyond, teaching me that consistency matters more than any single performance.

Now studying **Sports Marketing & Event Management** at university, exploring how the discipline I've learned from athletics translates into the business side of sports. I'm curious about event coordination, digital marketing strategies, and how new technologies are reshaping the industry.

> I treat the Olympics like a personal holiday.*

## Things I think about

**The intersection of sports and business**: Athletes spend years perfecting their craft, but there's an entire ecosystem of marketing, branding, sponsorships, and event logistics that makes the industry function. Understanding both the athletic and business perspectives creates unique opportunities.

**Digital innovation in traditional sports**: How do you bring something as physical and immediate as figure skating into the digital space in a way that feels authentic? How do organizations balance tradition with technological advancement?

**Adaptability as a core skill**: Whether it's adjusting to a new coach, performing in an unfamiliar rink, or switching languages mid-conversation, sports taught me to stay flexible. That adaptability is probably the most transferable skill I have, and it applies to everything from event planning to digital strategy.

**The journey vs. the destination**: In competitive sports, you learn quickly that growth happens in the quiet mornings at practice, not just in the spotlight of competition. I try to apply that mindset to everything I do.

*"I like to stay open, keep growing and find meaning in the journey, not just the destination."*
